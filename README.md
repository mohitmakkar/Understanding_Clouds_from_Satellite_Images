# Understanding_Clouds_from_Satellite_Images
Climate change has been at the top of our minds and on the forefront of important political decision-making for many years. Shallow clouds play a huge role in determining the Earth's climate.  They’re also difficult to understand and to represent in climate models.
There are many ways in which clouds can organize, but the boundaries between different forms of organization are murky.  This makes it challenging to build traditional rule-based algorithms to separate cloud features.   
The human eye, however, is really good at detecting features—such as clouds that resemble flowers. 
In this Kaggle challenge, We are developling a Deep Learning model to classify cloud organization patterns from satellite images. This research will guide the development of next-generation models which could reduce uncertainties in climate projections.
